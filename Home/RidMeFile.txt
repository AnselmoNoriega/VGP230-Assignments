The game is played only using A (to move right), D (to move Left) and space to shoot. However, if you press C, all box colliders will show.
Every time you kill all enemies on screen (which takes one shot to kill them) you will pass to the next wave.
However, there's a 10% chance that instead of getting to the next wave, a boss will appear. The main goal of this game is to kill the boss
(which will kill you in one shot). If you kill the boss you win.
You can only have 5 bullets on screen, if you try to shoot and the bullets haven't exited the screen nothing will happen.
You only have 2 lives. if you lose one, your progress won't be lost and your health will regenerate. But this only apply in normal waves, if the boss kills you you will lose all progress
